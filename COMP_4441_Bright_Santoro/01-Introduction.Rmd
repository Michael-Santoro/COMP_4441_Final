**Purpose**

Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grape juice. (Puckette) Generally, a wine's quality is determined by taste, smell, and visual tests performed by wine experts, sommeliers. These tests grade the wine on subjective measures: Acidity, Sweetness, Alcohol, Tannin and Aroma.  Though these tests are subjective, there is overlap between the observation of these characteristics and a wine's physiochemical properties.  For example, a wine's perceived acidity or tartness is based upon the pH of the wine and a wine's perceived sweetness is based upon the residual sugar of the wine.  

The goal of our research is to determine:

Can we predict the subjective quality rating of wine based solely on its physiochemical properties?

An accurate predictive model for determining an objective quality of wine would enable small wineries and vineyards, especially those from less established wine regions, to more accurately price their inventory and ensure a better return on investment.   

**Statistical or Analytical Method**

We will be using the the following statistical methods to create predictive models for quality of wine:

- Elastic Net Regression (LASSO and Ridge)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbor
