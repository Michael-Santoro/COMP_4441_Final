# Data Cleaning and Partitioning

## Data Normalization
Our dataset already contains only predictive values and output, so we do not need to remove any descriptive columns.  We must normalize the values within the dataset to avoid any bias and remove the output variable (quality) since it's the prediction. 
```{r}
set.seed(123)

# do not include wine type in partitioned data.
wine <-wine[,1:12]
#Normalization
normalize <- function(x) {
return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))) }

#only normalize variables
wine.normal <- as.data.frame(lapply(wine[,1:11], normalize))

# add quality back 
wine.normal$quality = wine$quality

head(wine.normal)

```


## Data Partitioning

In order to determine whether our models are effective we must partition our dataset into a training and test set. 

```{r}


ind <- sample(2, nrow(wine.normal), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7, 0.3))

train <- wine.normal[ind==1, ]
test <- wine.normal[ind==2,]

```
