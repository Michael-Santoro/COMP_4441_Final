## Introduction
The project presented below will explore the relationship between the outcome of two dependent variables of wine, value and quality, and their chemical composition: including measures such as acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol percentage. A predictive model for pricing and quality of wine can provide guidance to small wineries and vineyards, especially those from less established wine regions, so that they can more accurately price their inventory and ensure a better return on investment. It will explore different regression techniques and compare their effectiveness.

## The Data
```{r}
